This folder contains Voronoi page segmentation code by K. Kise. I have modified
the code to compile it with g++, added voronoi namespace, restrucured the code
to be usable as a library, and wrote wrapper classes to implement ISegmentPage
interface. Besides I have made a few bug fixes that resulted in segmentation
faults on 64-bit machines. The bug fixes are explicitly marked with /*Faisal
Shafait's modifications*/ tags.

1. How to Install

The code has two build files:
  - Makefile builds the code with the same input/output as that of
    original Kise's code  
  - Jamfile builds the code with the color-coded input/output
    conforming to the ISegmentPage interface in OCRopus

2. How to Use

  (1) To get original output (voronoi line segments text file)
	1- make
	2- ./be in.tif in-edges.txt
	the output file "in-edges.txt" can be visualized using dl program
	3- drawing/dl -i in.tif -l in-edges.txt -o out.tif

  (2) To get OCRopus ISegmentPage conformed output
	1- jam
	2- ./voronoi in.png out.png
